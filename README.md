## Overview

Collider-Agent enables AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and more) to autonomously reproduce collider phenomenology results from physics papers. It combines specialized sub-agents and reusable skill modules that interface with standard HEP tools via the [Magnus](https://github.com/Rise-AGI/magnus) cloud platform — no local HEP software installation required.

**Full pipeline, fully automated:**

- Parse a LaTeX Lagrangian and generate a FeynRules model
- Validate the model and produce a UFO output for MadGraph5
- Run parton-level and showered event generation with MadGraph5 + Pythia8
- Apply detector simulation (Delphes) and analysis cuts (MadAnalysis5)
- Generate kinematic distributions, cutflow tables, exclusion contours in parameter space, etc.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — recommended; provides full support for both sub-agents and skills
  
  > Other agents with skills support also work (skills only, no sub-agents): Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Cline, Goose, Roo Code, and [more](#supported-agents-and-their-global-skills-paths)

- Python 3.10+ (requires `magnus-sdk>=0.7.0`)

### Setup

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HET-AGI/ColliderAgent.git
cd ColliderAgent
```

**2. Connect to the Magnus platform:**

First, install the Magnus SDK:

```bash
pip install magnus-sdk
```

<details>
<summary>☁️ Option A: Connect to an existing cloud instance</summary>

If you have access to a cloud-hosted Magnus instance, authenticate with:

```bash
magnus login
```

Enter your server URL and API key when prompted. All subsequent commands are routed to the remote backend automatically.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🖥️ Option B: Local deployment</summary>

> [!WARNING]
> Local Magnus deployment is under active development and may contain known issues. It is **not recommended for general use** at this time. A stable release is expected no later than **March 29, 2026**.

**Additional prerequisites:** Docker (daemon running), Node.js (optional, enables the Web UI)

Start the local backend:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/setup_magnus.py --start-local
```

This fetches the Magnus source, installs backend dependencies, starts the server on port `8017`, and creates a local database and user account. If Node.js is installed, a Web UI is also launched at `http://localhost:3011`.

The setup command then registers and verifies this repository's MadGraph and
MadAnalysis blueprints, including the fork and repaired container references.
Use it for subsequent starts too: plain `magnus local start` registers Magnus's
bundled definitions and can overwrite these references. To update an already
running station, run `.venv/bin/python scripts/setup_magnus.py`; to verify without
changing it, add `--check`. These commands use your active Magnus station.

Verify the setup:

```bash
magnus run hello-world
```

A successful run prints `Hello from Magnus!` after pulling the required container image.

</details>

> For full Magnus documentation and deployment options, see [github.com/Rise-AGI/magnus](https://github.com/Rise-AGI/magnus).

**3. Copy agents and skills to your agent's configuration directory.**

For **Claude Code** (full support: sub-agents + skills):

```bash
cp -r src/agents ~/.claude/agents
cp -r src/skills ~/.claude/skills
```

For **other agents** (skills only):

```bash
# Replace <skills-path> with the global skills path for your agent (see table below)
cp -r src/skills <skills-path>
```

<a id="supported-agents-and-their-global-skills-paths"></a>

**Supported agents and their global skills paths:**

| Agent          | Global skills path            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | `~/.claude/skills/`           |
| Cursor         | `~/.cursor/skills/`           |
| Windsurf       | `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/` |
| GitHub Copilot | `~/.copilot/skills/`          |
| Gemini CLI     | `~/.gemini/skills/`           |
| Cline / Warp   | `~/.agents/skills/`           |
| Goose          | `~/.config/goose/skills/`     |
| Roo Code       | `~/.roo/skills/`              |
| OpenCode       | `~/.config/opencode/skills/`  |
| Codex          | `~/.codex/skills/`            |

> [!TIP]
> Project-scoped installation is also supported. Copy `src/skills/` into `.claude/skills/` (or the equivalent directory for your agent) at the root of your working directory to scope the skills to that project only.

**4. Restart your agent** to load the new agents and skills.

**5. (Optional) Activate the Wolfram Engine license:**

<details>
<summary>🔬 Configure Mathematica / Wolfram Engine license</summary>

The FeynRules-based blueprints (`feynrules-model-validator`, `ufo-generator`) require a Wolfram Engine license. Because the license is tied to the machine identity of the *container* rather than the host, activation must be performed inside the container itself.

1. Register a free Wolfram ID at [wolfram.com/engine/free-license](https://wolfram.com/engine/free-license)

2. Run the activation inside the container:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.wolfram-container-license
docker run -it --rm \
  -v ~/.wolfram-container-license:/root/.WolframEngine/Licensing \
  git.pku.edu.cn/het-agi/mma-het:latest wolframscript
```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to enter your Wolfram ID and password.

The license file (`mathpass`) is written to `~/.wolfram-container-license/` on the host, which all subsequent FeynRules blueprint runs mount automatically. This step is only needed once.

</details>

## Quickstart

The fastest way to try Collider-Agent is to run a standard-model dilepton invariant mass plot — a classic parton-level check — directly from the command line:

```bash
claude -p "Plot the dilepton invariant mass distribution for parton-level pp -> l+l- process at the 14 TeV LHC in the SM." --dangerously-bypass-permissions
```

This runs the full pipeline non-interactively: MadGraph5 generates the events via [Magnus](https://github.com/rise-agi/magnus), and the agent produces a normalized $m_{\ell\ell}$ histogram in your working directory.

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. Prepare a detailed Markdown prompt (for example, `prompt.md`) describing the collider analysis you want to run, including the Lagrangian, collider process, event selection, and parameter scan strategy, much like you would write your own research note or paper draft (see `paper-reproduction/` for examples)

2. Start your agent and provide the prompt:

```bash
claude -p "Execute the analysis following prompt.md"
```

3. The system orchestrates the full pipeline:
   - Parse the Lagrangian and generate a FeynRules model
   - Validate and generate the UFO model
   - Run MadGraph5 simulations with Pythia8 / Delphes
   - Apply analysis cuts with MadAnalysis5
   - Generate the analysis outputs, such as kinematic distribution plots, parameter exclusion regions, and any other results requested in the user prompt


### Standalone Tasks

The agent can also be used for individual sub-tasks, without running the full collider-phenomenology pipeline. For example, you can ask it to:

- translate a Lagrangian written in standard LaTeX-based physics notation into a FeynRules `.fr` model file
- generate events for a process at the LHC based on a `UFO` model file
- analyze Monte Carlo events with MadAnalysis to produce a kinematic distribution plot

For instance, you may provide a prompt like:

```bash
claude -p "Given the Lagrangian in prompt_lagrangian.md, generate a FeynRules .fr model and export the corresponding UFO files"
```
Here, `prompt_lagrangian.md` contains the Lagrangian written in standard LaTeX physics notation.

### Example Prompts

The `paper-reproduction/` directory contains example prompts to reproduce figures in the following papers:

## Python Agent

In addition to the skill-based interface, ColliderAgent ships a **standalone Python ADK agent** and a set of **Magnus cloud blueprint scripts** for users who want direct programmatic access to the pipeline — without Claude Code or any other AI coding assistant.

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| [`python-agent/`](python-agent/) | Google ADK agent that accepts natural-language physics tasks and orchestrates the full pipeline via Python API. Includes `uv`-based setup, interactive `CLI.py`, and a full test suite. |
| [`scripts/`](scripts/) | Entry-point scripts executed by Magnus blueprint containers. Each script corresponds to a named blueprint (`validate-feynrules`, `generate-ufo`, `madgraph-compile`, etc.) called by the agent's tools. |

> [!NOTE]
> If you only want to use Collider-Agent through Claude Code (or another AI agent), you don't need these directories. They are intended for programmatic access, custom integrations, and pipeline development.
